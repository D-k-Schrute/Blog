Today i started a little side project of a website blog.
the main purpose is to not only build confidence in myself and my abilities but to also share and to grown knowledge along the way.
im hoping this is the first small step i can take to really make a difference and help others on there cyber journey regardless of the adversity in their way.
never thought i would have a website but the $20 or so seemed like a worth while risk haha.
